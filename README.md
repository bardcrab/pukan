### Pukan API - is abstraction layer over Vulkan API.
---
Pukan aims to provide high level solution for development of high performance applications. It combines both ease of use and excellent results. With Pukan you can quickly develop fast and robust applications that needs power of modern hardware for running computations in parallel with highly efficient usage of resources.

Pukan stands for keep simple things simple. For example, such common thing has "hello, world." application with Pukan consist only of few lines of code. You not need spend hours on reading tons of documentation as in case with other API's to get things ready. Pukan comes with built-in "hello. world." implementation `PkHelloTriangle` that is part of Pukan API code base. Innovative approach of Pukan API can save a lot of time for everyone that uses it, because many common things is already included as part of Pukan implementation. Now, every time you want your hello world - it is here, enjoy!

Pukan consist of tools with clear purpose that will give you power to make great things without diving into forest of strange gimmicks like memory management and execution synchronization. For example, Pukan includes tuned and ready to use tools to make nicely looking gaming scene in just few minutes. With tools like `PkWonderfulGrass`, `PkBeautifulSky` and `PkBlueWater` you can make nearly next-generation triple 'A' gaming environment with ridiculously small code footprint that runs smoothly on any hardware configuration due to efficient machine resources usage that Pukan does for you. That's it!
